                    <h3>Humanoid<br></h3>
<!--<h4>A programmed humanoid that serves your domestic purposes at a push of a button</h4>-->
<p>Have you ever wondered what you can achieve if you are free of all the daily routine
and mundane and unproductive tasks that we are burdened with? If all your time is
free for productive use, imagine how much you can achieve and how your life would
be more enriching. This is not impossible. That’s how Humanoid will change your
life</p><br>
<h5>Product Description:</h5>
<p>Here’s something that does all kinds of work – home work, house work, office work,
baby sitting, child care, elderly care and so on so forth.
“Enru” is a humanoid which is programmed to do all such tasks and what is more, it
can even be like you own personalized assistant. Here’s a list of all the stuff it can do
    for you (expect the unbelievable – in other words, to experience magic):</p><br>
    <ul type="square">
                <li>
                    Clean your house
                </li>
                    <li>
                        Take care of your children, play with them and teach them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be your own encyclopedia – like, it will answer all your questions like say, who is the father of Newton, and even suggest which film to watch.
                    </li>
                    <li>Offer basic diagnosis in a medical emergency situation</li>
<li>Can talk in 14 languages and 5 accents</li>
<li>Can serve you as a Receptionist in your office</li>
<li>Can do small tasks like serving tea, take a photocopy, etc</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>
Here’s how it works: Enru runs on solar power and needs one single charge per
month. It can manage for nearly 10 days with or without the sun. It is connected and
secured with Cloud Intranet Secured Socket. Enru comes with basic programs but
you can update the new versions from his personal app.
We wish to gift this “unbelievable-but -true” product at an equally unbelievable price
of US$1500, plus a replacement warranty for two years. There is more we offer, but
you have to wait for the official launch with all required government approvals.
Use Enru, your humanoid to free up your time and instantly add years to your life!
                    </p><br>

<!--<h4>Surveillance devices that commands, controls and saves our borders</h4>-->

    <p>
        If we can invent war, why can’t we invent peace? If Man is responsible for war, he is
also equally capable of ushering Peace. Imagine living in a world where nations are
not at war, where law & order in your streets is safer, and all the billions of dollars
that are spent on arms and weaponry can be diverted to better the quality of life.
Another gem of a magical product in the works from us:
    </p><br>
 <h5>Product description:</h5>
    <p>We are creating a 47SDT device with a classified command control that can be used
by countries to fence their borders. Using this device will ensure no one can enter
your border without your permission, either from SEA, AIR, or LAND. This product
can also be used to make our streets safer and preserve and protect law & order.
The benefits of using this device are quite simply mind boggling. There can really be
        no faster way to achieve world peace.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<!--<h4>A Technology that can transfer our thoughts and Crawls the Web through Mind Power</h4>-->

    <p>The Internet has dramatically changed the way we consume data and communicate
within a space of a few decades. The next change we are working on will bring in a
new wave of communication that will virtually render the Internet redundant. Know
how</p><br>
<h5>Product description:</h5>
    <p>
        We are in an advanced stage of research to translate our concept of maximizing
mind-power. With this, in the near future, you don’t have to Google online using your
mobile or laptop to access any information. You can use your mind itself to crawl the
web, as it will be linked to a single brain server. Simply put, you have the power of a
Google, or a search engine, within you. Not only that, you can transfer your thoughts
from one place to another, and to another person.
To give you an idea of how it works, you can transfer your thoughts to another place
or another person through what we call BLFRCW (Brain low-frequency radio
communication waves). Once we are ready to roll out our vision, it will be as defining
a moment as when the Internet was invented!</p>

<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<!--<h4>Technology that conserves energy and serves Earth’s needs </h4>-->
    <p>There is only so much energy that is available for all of us and since we just cannot
do without it, dealing with energy scarcity and preserving it is a permanent challenge
– like a sword that is hanging on Mother Earth!</p>
<br><h5>Product description:</h5>
    <p>
        Since Energy can neither be created nor destroyed and only transferred, we are
working on how to adopt and harness brick technology to create and preserve
energy from all possible sources on earth. We are at work on this everyday to find a
solution for everyone so that we have all the energy to humans and also our planet.

<!--<h4>A Medical Technology which can track your body and keep you healthy</h4>-->

<p>We all know what it takes to be and stay healthy: Eat right, exercise, be active,
meditate, and so on and so forth. But there is that X factor – that is, when we are in
a sudden, unexpected emergency – panic attack, heart attack, etc. How does one
deal with this Unexpected Factor?</p><br>
<h5>Product description:</h5>
    <p>
We are researching on a futuristic concept where a chip planted in our body from the
time of birth helps us to keep track of our health and fitness on a daily - real-time -
basis. This chip will transfer real-time data to the nearest diagnosis centre to
facilitate prompt supervision or emergency attention at your doorstep in no time.
The idea is to put you in safer hands, right when you are in an emergency, or you
need immediate medical intervention.</p><br>

<h3 id="behavior">Behavior Pattern Secured Login DNA Layer:</h3>
<!--<h4>An online-behavior virtual technology that secures your privacy</h4>-->
<p>
With almost the entire world moving online, Privacy and security concerns have
become the greatest hurdle. While technology has tried to keep pace with
innovations like retina scans and thumb impressions, clearly a lot more needs to be
done. What’s up next? Something impossibly amazing...
</p><br>
    <h5>Product description:</h5>

<p>We have developed a BPSS (Behavior Pattern Security Socket) system that
enables you to login by checking your online behavior – which is a giant leap from
finger login, retina scan, etc. Our system identifies your online behavior from
various parameters based on your personal traits – like your exact finger weight
you put on your keyboard; your typing speed; your weight and speed of use of your
mouse; plus, it factors in the kind of websites you generally visit. The BPSS lices
and dices all this personal data to come up with your unique online behaviour
pattern and give you your online DNA ID. It is 100% secure and safe since it is
neither saved nor seen by this system. It just follows your online behavior pattern
and creates a password for you instantly. You can also log in instantly and no one
can take or hack your password because it is based on your DNA, which is totally
    unique and personal.</p><br>
<p>The best part with BPSS is, you don’t have to save your passwords like now and
    virtually everything is in your control.</p>

<h3 id="programming">“Programming” Laptop and Mobile for IT Developers</h3>
<!--<h4>A service which can code anything in any programmed language</h4>-->
    <p>
        After SaaS (Software as a Service) came into play, IT programmers and developers
have turned from coolies to mules, writing the same code again and again. If only
there was a way out to buy a program that meets one’s requirement sort of
off-the-shelf just like that, without having to code, decode, and recode...
    </p><br>

<h5>Product description:</h5>

<p>Yes, there is a way out. We have created a new product that does not more for less,
but much more for less: A platform which shows up any programme you are
otherwise required to write for, in all possible languages like C, C++, dot net, java,
python, ruby and much more. This platform can code anything in any language
customized to your requirement. All you, a developer, company, or even a website</p>
    <p>
        designer or individual, need to do is subscribe to this platform, post your
requirement, and you will get the code in less than the time it takes to drink your
cappuccino, i.e. ten minutes!
The platform comes in-built into a laptop and the laptop itself comes with an in-built
screen motion detector so if you’re not in front of screen things will stop
automatically.
The gains on the bottom-line are really awesome. To give you but one example, our
product will help you to create an App in a day – as against the 10-18 weeks it
generally takes to create a Version 1.0 of an app. Our platform uses AI to deliver
“magical” results – and it’s for real.

<h3>Robotics Voice Transformation</h3>
<!--<h4>An AI-Voice Transformation technology that eases the customer care services.</h4>-->
    <p>
        We have developed a Robotic Voice Transformation to enable our AI handle all your
customers in the language they understand. Additionally, an intellectual AI is there
who can decipher the dual points of view of your customers and agents. For
instance, say there is an agent handling a bad customer. Our AI will select the best
solution given by one of the agents and represent it in the same way like the agent.
So now you don’t need a human developer for creating an App. Plus, you save
money and time and human resources too, like one AI and one Human can do the
        work of 10 people!</p><br>
<p>We are also working on a unique future based social media platform which is
education and technologically friendly.

<!--<h4>A technology which packs and saves power in every sense</h4>-->
<h5>Product Description:</h5>

<p>Electricity doesn’t come cheap, depletes natural resources, impacts Planet Earth,
and worse, when you are careless with it, it can even lead to a calamity. All this
together makes for a very unfair trade-off for the people, just because they cannot
do without power</p>
    <p>
        Rising to the challenge, we are developing Solar Bricks – an alternative based on
solar power whose supply is unlimited. These solar bricks will be very low-priced and
come with in-built auto off sensors which switch off the power when no one is at
home. A house of 6 with all domestic appliances can use this solar device for a year
by paying less than $200.
